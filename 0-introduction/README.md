# 0 Introduction

- developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979
- originally developed as an extension of C
  - C++ code was compiled into C-Code back then
- nowadays, we can still write and compile pure C code in C++
- language was sort of discontinued for a long time after '98
- since 2011, we have three-year update-cycles:
  - C++ 11 (2011)
    - this was a massive update
    - era of "Modern C++" began
    - RAII (resource acquisition is initialization)
  - C++ 14
  - C++ 17
  - C++ 20
  - soon: C++ 23

## Platform dependent
- a compiled program will run on one platform only

## Intermediate-level language
- supports both high-level and low-level programming

## Object-oriented
- support for classes and objects

## Structured
- you can use functions

## Statically-typed
- variable types are explicit and determined at compile-time

## Compiled
- programs can not be executed without compilation

## Support-rich library
- STL (C++ Standard Template Library) provides a lot of common functionality

## Speed
- native machine code compilation and hardware-level optimizations enable high performance

## Multi-paradigm
- support for many different programming styles, very extensible

## Pointer
- pointers can be used for high-performance memory access
